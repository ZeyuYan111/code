				<p id='p1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a
					hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but
					rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the
					walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or
					painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with
					the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set
					off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise
					ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting
					will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right
					balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.
				</p>
				<p id='p2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great
					temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a
					large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can
					hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide,
					follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a
					painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of
					absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting
					perfectly.
				</p>
				<p id='p3'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface
					upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the
					sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. A new painting, even
					one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it
					is selected with the greatest care.</p>
				<p id='p4'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the
					paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest.
					Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the
					secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the
					work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that
					the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we
					gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the
					shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in
					this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the
					darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak
					probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we as children would feel an
					inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never
					penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the
					shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.
				</p>
				<p id='p5'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light
					from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery
					and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by
					no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were
					taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of
					the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white
					glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.
