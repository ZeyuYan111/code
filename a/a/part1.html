				<p id='p1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic
					cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the
					heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan,
					on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows
					created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; in the
					palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the
					massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday
					cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and
					pillars all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the
					remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the
					impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the
					eaves. </p>
				<p id='p2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth,
					and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western
					houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from
					without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the
					interior to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a
					Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight
					to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building
					materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for
					instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would no
					doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty,
					however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark
					rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's
					ends.</p>
				<p id='p3'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy
					shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of
					Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is
					understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the
					sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build
					on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in
					but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the
					charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink
					into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the
					walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would
					destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate
					glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life
					remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far
					surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with
					sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference
					will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem
					to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the
					walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.</p>
